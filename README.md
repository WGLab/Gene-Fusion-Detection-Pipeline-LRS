# Gene-Fusion-Detection-Pipeline-LRS
The Gene Fusion (GF) Detection Pipeline is comprehensive bioinformatics workflow designed for Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data. This pipeline leverages GF detection programs, namely, LongGF, JAFFA, and FusionSeeker, to identify GFs. It incorporates filtering criteria, cross-referencing with established fusion databases, and manual validation steps for robust analysis of the fusions. the GF Detection Pipeline was adapted from clinical cancer patient samples and works on long-read sequencing datasets, providing insights into known and potentially novel GFs, contributing to advancements in cancer diagnostics and precision medicine.
