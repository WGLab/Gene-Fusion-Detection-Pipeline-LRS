# GF Detection Pipeline Requirements and Scripts
This section provides an overview of the programs, reference files, input files, and scripts required for the GF detection pipeline workflow. Each script has a brief description of its goal and expected output. We suggest creating a conda environment for running the programs, `conda create -n GF_detection_LRS python=3.9`, and optimizing script runtime on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster/computer for the best results.

## Programs 
```
Guppy6
Cutadapt (v4.6)
Minimap2 (v2.26)
Samtools (v1.19.2)
LongGF 
JAFFA (v2.3) 
FusionSeeker (v1.0.1) 
LongReadSum (v1.3.1)
Python (3.9)
```

## Input File Types
The pipeline is designed to take in a single input file, which can be in either `FAST5`, `FASTQ`, or `FASTA` format. If the input is in `FAST5` format, it is recommended to use Guppy6 (Available online: https://community.nanoporetech.com) to perform basecalling first, with the default basecalling read Q-score filtering threshold of 7, and then convert the FASTQ files for downstream analysis. If dealing with multiple `FASTQ` or `FASTA` files, it is best to merge the files using the `cat` command beforehand.
